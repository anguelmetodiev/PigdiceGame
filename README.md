2 - Player Game Developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The UI - Interface includes: 
<li>New Game - Reset the current game and start fresh</li>
<li>Roll Dice - Rolling a single dice 1,2,3,4,5 and 6</li>
<li>Hold - Add the current score to the total score of the player</li>

<br>
You have 1/6 or 16.67% of rolling a 1.
When a player rolls a 1 all the points accumulated during that turn will be lost and the next player rolls the dice. Each player has the option to continue rolling the dice multiple times. Player can choose to Hold (in other words, save the score and give to the other player to play) or execute the greedy approach and continue playing.
The user can set up a score required to win the game in the input box SCORE.
Whoever reaches first that score wins the game.
If no score is set, the game will automatically set 100 as required score to win the game.
